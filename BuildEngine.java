/**
 * Walks the player around a schematic and places it, one block per tick, without any further input.
 *
 * <p>The plan is ordered bottom-up, but the engine does not follow it blindly. Real schematics
 * (especially machines and traps) often have blocks that float with nothing beside them until their
 * neighbours exist, and vanilla cannot place a block with no face to click. So each tick the engine
 * looks for the earliest block in the plan it can place <em>right now</em> — one whose cell it can
 * break, or which has a solid neighbour to place against — and leaves the rest queued. That lets a
 * floating cluster build itself out from whichever block first gets support. When nothing remaining
 * can be placed, the build ends cleanly and the leftovers are reported as floating.
 *
 * <p>Everything happens on the client thread from the client tick. Movement is driven with the real
 * {@link GameOptions} key bindings rather than by writing {@code player.input}, because the game
 * recomputes that input from the keyboard every tick — and it only takes effect while no screen is
 * open, so the engine walks only when the menu is closed and places whenever it is in range.
